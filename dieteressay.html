	Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer, has confined his philosophy of good design into ten rules that should be taken into consideration, when thinking about design. The first rule of law, according to Rams, states that "good design is innovative". I agree to an extent. The extent being that as an aspiring graphic designer, my creativity should be exercised and pushed daily. This helps bring about new and refreshing ideas that can be contributed to the world of the design. In the second rule for good design, Rams believes that "good design makes a product useful". In the world of product design, this rule is absolutely important. Product design is for the consumers. A product is usually designed to attract attention while maintaining it's functionality to be used for its targeted audience. If the product does not function as it was designed to be, then the product is useless. Rule three, "good design is aesthetic" pretty much follow rule two. Rule three main goal is attract it's consumer while it's functionality is accessible and easy to understand. Dieter Rams' forth rule in his philosophy of good design is as follow, "good design makes a product understandable". In most cases, this is true but no always. When working on a product to be consumed by others, this rule would be true, but in the field of graphic design, it can steer away from the rule. I remember working on a project where I was told to intentionally make the type unrecognizable to the point that it could not be understood. The point of the project was to focus on the elements and the shapes that came from the type. Next, "good design should be unobtrusive", when thinking about this rule, as a designer, we must think about any and everyone that may interact with our designs. Thinking about everyone could shift our creative juices in a more broader way. Another rule, "good design is honest" is a tough give my insight on. Yes, you want to be honest by follow giving guide lines and restrictions but it's ok to go crazy and be wild with design. I'm stuck in a tight place when considering Rams' philosophy on this topic. Dieter's rule seven, "good design is long-lasting", has me on the fence. Almost nothing is long lasting in the world of design. New designer sprouting fresh ideas everyday and technology that assist today's artist has help shift the design world into a new era. Design will forever be changing but some method will become foundational in some areas. Rams' rule eight "good design is thorough to the last detail". Design is ALL ABOUT THE DETAILS, I remember working in my type one and two class where details were to be calculated all the way down to the space between letters. Everything most have a reason as to way it existence in the first place. Rule nine, "good design is environmentally friendly". This is inevitable, trash is always being produce in the design world. From printing mock ups, to producting products trash will always be made. So this rule of law is tough to follow. Lastly, Dieter final rule, rule ten states, "good design is as little design as possible". Well, I find this law to be very considerable. I approach design in a minimalist way and believe its makes design very sophisticated and appealing. Its just something about space and emptiness that appeals to me. Maybe its a reflection of my views of the world around me.
