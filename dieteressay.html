	<h1>1. Good Design Is Innovative</h1> 
	<p>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself. <br> <br>This first rule of law means that new creative ideas for design are endless. With technology constantly evolving , this opens the door of design to evolve with it. This evolution sparks fresh ideas for innovative designs. <br> <br> An example of this would be the television. The radio was a main factor for individuals to retrieve information in the comfort of their home. The television integrated both audio and visuals to produce information for its viewers. This device was seen as both innovative and revolutionary. <br> <br>As an aspiring graphic designer, I use technology to helps understand the relates between design and technology through projects, such as web designs and design photograpghy.</p>
	
	<h1>2. Good Design Makes A Product Useful</h1> 
	<p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it. <br> <br>A product is usually designed to attract attention while maintaining it's functionality to be used for its targeted audience. It must be easily accessible and understanding in its use. <br> <br>An example of this would be a calculator. The calculator interface is rather simple in design and easy to use. <br> <br>I plan on taking this into conderation when developing for a website.
	</p>
	
	<h1>3. Good Design Is Aesthetic</h1> 
	<p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful. <br> <br>This rule's main goal is attract the consumer. The design of a subject is catered around the idea of captivating an individual into buying and/or admiring the designed subject. <br> <br> An example of this would be a cellular devices. The variety of the cellphone’s design allows for indiviudals to select a phone thats appeals to their’s personal taste. <br> <br> This is a rule well applied when considering a design for someone other than myself. 
	</p> 
	
	<h1>4. Good Design Makes A Product Understandable</h1> 
	<p>It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.<br> <br> This rule is stating that if a product’s design is to be user friendly, then the product functions should be self explanatory.  
	<br> <br>An example of this would be headphone. The function of the headphones are very user friendly and speaks for its self on how to operate them.<br> <br>I plan on keeping this rule in the back of my mind when creating UX designs in the future .</p>
	
	<h1>5. Good Design Should Be Unobtrusive</h1>
	<p>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.<br> <br>We must think about any and everyone that may interact with our designs.<br> <br>An exmaple of this would be an electronic map. Features should be added to fit the adgenda of the individual using the device.<br> <br>My application on this rule is to consider those that may come into the path of my design and to have my design open to being personalized for the individual.</p> 
	
	<h1>6. Good Design Is Honest</h1>
	<p>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.<br> <br>The purpose of this rule is to maintain a guidline and restrictions for yourself that would help maintain order for the design.<br> <br>An example of this would be any designer’s projects. Maintaining a honest approach while designing gives positive results.<br> <br>I apply this rule in every project I’ve worked on. Creating these guildine helps bring order to the my projects.</p>
	
	<h1>7. Good Design Is Long-lasting</h1>
	<p>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years — even in today’s throwaway society.<br> <br>Dieter Rams is stating the good design soon be last long.<br> <br> An example would be the television. The idea of the television has being long lasting since it reached the scene back in the early 1930s, but its aesethtic has undergone countless changes.<br> <br>Almost nothing is long lasting in the world of design. New designer are sprouting fresh ideas everyday and technology that assist us today has help shift the design world into a new era. Design will forever be changing.</p>
	
	<h1>8. Good Design Is Thorough</h1>
	<p>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.<br> <br>This rule is stating that designer should always pay close attention to the details.<br> <br>An example of this would be any design project that requires a thorough examination of the detail persented.<br> <br>Design is ALL ABOUT THE DETAILS, I remember working in my type one and two class where details were to be calculated all the way down to the space between letters. Everything most have a reason as to way it existence in the first place.</p>
	
	<h1>9. Good Design Is Environmentally Friendly</h1>
	<p>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.<br> <br>This rule simply means that we a designer have a responsibiltiy of maintaining a healthy environment.<br> <br>An example of this is tough, considering that no matter what we design, it can be converted into waste.<br> <br>This is inevitable, trash is always being produce in the design world. From printing mock ups, to producting products trash will always be made. I would try to apply this rule more, in the future.</p>
	
	<h1>10. Good Design Is As Little Design As Possible</h1>
	<p>Less, but better — because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.<br>Back to purity, back to simplicity.<br> <br>Simply put, Less is better.<br> <br> Well, I find this law to be very considerable. I approach design in a minimalist way and believe its makes design very sophisticated and appealing. Its just something about space and emptiness that appeals to me. Perhaps, its a reflection of my views of the world around me.</p>
