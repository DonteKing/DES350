	Top 3 Portfolios
	
	<div class="blank"></div>
	
	1. http://heathershaw.com <br>
	
	<div class="blank"></div>
	This first portfolio is a great starting point for graphic and web designers, who are looking for clean and professional ideas for their own personal portfolio.<br> The layout of this portfolio is very clean and organize. In addition, the color scheme and flow of elements are very subtle and pleasing to view.

	3. http://www.pandayoghurt.co.uk
	
	<div class="blank"></div>
		This is perhaps my favorite of the three portfolios.
	The overall aesethic of the porfolio is very simple. Its made of two columns with an easy navigation system.<br>
	The best part of this portfolio is the work presented. <br>
	I found the body of work to be unique and mesmerizing, beautiful even.
